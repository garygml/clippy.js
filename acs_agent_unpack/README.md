I was vibe coding a little bit but I used a python script and a Decompiler to process an ACS file to generate the agent.js, map.png and sounds-mp3.js files that are needed for adding a clippy.js agent.

In the folder I have Dolphin (or actually the name is supposed to be Kairu) file name DOLPHIN.ACS. 

1. Put your ACS at the root directory, 
2. Unzip DecompileMSAgent.zip and Run the ACS decompiler. This is downloaded from http://www.lebeausoftware.org/software/decompile.aspx, after that you will have a Decompiled directory with /Audio, /Images and a .acd file. 
3. The python code I wrote (mostly generated by AI) reads the ACS file to get the animation list, but also uses the Decompiled Audio .wav files to generate sounds-mp3.js, and uses Images .bmp files to generate map.png

4. Install Python (if you don't have it): https://www.python.org/downloads/")
5. Install FFmpeg (required by pydub for audio conversion):
   - Windows: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ `winget install ffmpeg`
   - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg` (using Homebrew)
   - Linux: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Debian/Ubuntu)

6. I was on a Mac so I did these to create virtual environment and installed prerequisites
   ```python3 -m venv venv```
   ```source venv/bin/activate```
   if you are on windows you may need to do
   ```py -m venv venv```
   ```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

7. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (if you are on python 3.13 you may also need to do ```pip install audioop-lts```)

8. You may need to change main.py for the agent name and your ACS file name in the main method
   Finally do
```python main.py```

a ```agent.js``` file and a ```sounds-mp3.js``` file will be generated, a ```map.png``` will also be generated in the Images directory (I still need to use other software to get rid of the neon background transparency color separately but these files can then be used in the clippy js)
